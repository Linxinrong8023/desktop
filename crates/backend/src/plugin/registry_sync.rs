//! The cached marketplace registry index: reading it, rebuilding it, and admitting rebuilds.
//!
//! A rebuild drives the Git CLI over shared source checkouts and then replaces one cache file, so
//! only one may run at a time. Because every rebuild produces the same index for every caller,
//! the excess callers are turned away rather than queued: the rebuild already in flight is
//! producing the very result they asked for.
//!
//! Sources are refreshed one by one and a source that fails does not fail the rebuild: its
//! previous listings are carried over and the failure is reported, so one unreachable repository
//! cannot freeze every other source's listings or make a transient outage look like a withdrawal.
