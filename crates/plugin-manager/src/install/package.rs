//! Turns one verified release archive into a committed installed package.
//!
//! Everything a package must satisfy is checked here, while the extracted tree is still staged:
//! the manifest *inside* the archive is parsed and validated with the same code path discovery
//! uses, its identity is compared against the listing that published it, and a targeted release's
//! self-declared artifact target is matched against the selected release target. The caller
//! deletes the archive and any empty package parent when this fails, so no failure can leave a
//! half-materialized package behind.

/// so nothing is ever committed for it.
