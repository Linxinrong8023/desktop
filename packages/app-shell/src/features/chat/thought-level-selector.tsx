/**
 * The composer's thought-level (reasoning effort) control.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than the model picker: there is no pre-session catalog
 * for effort levels, and which levels exist depends on the agent — and, for
 * some agents, on the model in effect — so the only trustworthy source is the
 * `thought_level` option the provider session itself reports. The control
 * therefore renders nothing until a conversation carries that option, which
 * happens in exactly two places: the handshake performed by the first send, and
 * the replay of a persisted conversation. A chat that has not started shows no
 * effort control at all rather than guessing one.
 *
 * Effort is an ordered scale rather than a set of unrelated choices, so it is
 * presented as a slider over the levels in the order the agent listed them.
 * Dragging previews the level under the thumb; only releasing commits it, and
 * the commit goes straight through `session/set_config_option`, the same way a
 * model pick on a live session does. The provider answers with its full option
 * set, so a model change that reshapes the available levels is reflected here
 * without this component knowing about models.
 *
 * With an agent move pending, the conversation's options describe the agent it
 * is leaving, so the control withdraws until the move's handshake reports the
 * incoming agent's own levels.
